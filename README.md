# Aquifer Factsheets

This repository contains [R](http://www.r-project.org) code that generates aquifer factsheets for British Columbia. 

## Usage

The data sourced for the analyses is provided under the [Open Government Licence â€“ British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).

### Data - To be provided

Data sets used by, but not created in, these scripts are stored in the "./data/" folder and include:

**Groundwater Trends** (Temporary data, future to be accessed from finalized BC Groundwater datasets)  
- `analysis_data.RData`
- `raw_data.RData`

**Aquifer Data**  
- Aquifer data (`GW_AQUIFER_ATTRS_DATA_TABLE.csv`)
- Aquifer regions (`Aquifer Location Description and Regions.csv`)
- Aquifer water districts (`Aquifer_Water_District.csv`)
- Aquifer hydraulic connectivity (`Hydraulic Connectivity Table.csv`)

**Weather/Climate**  
- Climate Normals (`All stations BC_CCN_rainfall_snowfall_precip.csv`)
- Climate IDs (`Key_Aquifer_Obs well_EMS ID_climate ID.xlsx`)

**Miscellaneous**  
- Piper Plot descriptions (`piper_text.xlsx`)

### Data - To be downloaded

Data sets downloaded for use in these scripts (automatically downloaded by the `00_download.R` script) are stored in the "./data_dl/" folder and include:

- Daily mean water levels in observation wells (`obs_well_daily_mean.csv`)
- Well data (`well.csv` & `lithology.csv`)
- University of Victoria aquifer stress test results (`uvic_stress_index.xlsx`)
- Aquifer Subtype Index (`aquifer_subtypes.xlsx`)
- Water licences (`licenced_vol.csv`)


### Figures

Some figures are created as part of the analysis, some are created in other software. Additional figures used by, but not created in, these scripts are stored in the "./figures/" folder:  

- ./figures/maps/ - Aquifer maps (i.e., Aquifer_Map_0001.pdf)
- ./figures/piperplots/ - Piper plots (i.e., Piperplot_0001_OW0001.jpg)
- ./figures/na/ - Missing plot figures for Combo, Piper plots and Trend plots
- ./figures/boxplot_key.png - Figure explaining the boxplots for the companion document
- ./figures/BCID_H_cmyk_rev.pdf - BC Gov Logo

Download BC Government logo and unzip into figures folder (Then convert to pdf by hand)
```
if(!file.exists("./figures/BCID_H_cmyk_rev.eps")) {
  download.file(url = "http://www.corporate.gov.bc.ca/print-ads/Govt_of_BC_Logos/Resources/2018_BCID_Files.zip",
                dest = "./figures/2018_BCID_Files.zip")
  unzip(zipfile = "./figures/2018_BCID_Files.zip",
        files = "2018_BCID_Files/_Horizontal/Reverse/CMYK/BCID_H_cmyk_rev.eps",
        exdir = "./figures", junkpaths = TRUE)
  file.remove("./figures/2018_BCID_Files.zip")
}
```

### Code

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, they need to be run in order:

- 00_download.R
- 01_load.R
- 02_clean.R
- 03_output.R

**To create all factsheets**, it is best to use the helper script: **`run_all.R`**

This script will guide the user through aquifer selection and running the required analysis scripts sequentially.

### Packages and Software

Each script will first run the `00_header.R` script file which will ensure the correct folder structure and will install and load all relevant packages. 

An installation of LaTeX (e.g. MiKTex, MacTeX or [`tinytex`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tinytex/index.html)) is required to render the .Rmd files to PDF with `knitr`.

### Output

These scripts output Aquifer Factsheets and the Aquifer Factsheet Companion document to the "./factsheets/" folder.

- Factsheet for each Aquifer (e.g., for Aquifer #1 `AQ_00001_Aquifer_Factsheet.pdf`)
- A companion document containing methodological details (`Aquifer Factsheet - Companion Document.pdf`)

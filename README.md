# Aquifer Factsheets

This repository contains [R](http://www.r-project.org) code that generates aquifer factsheets for British Columbia. 


## Usage

### Data

The data sourced for the analyses is provided under the [Open Government Licence â€“ British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).

- Groundwater level monitoring data are downloaded from the 
  [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/57c55f10-cf8e-40bb-aae0-2eff311f1685) via the [`bcgroundwater` R package](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgroundwater)
- Groundwater well attribute data are downloaded directly from the
  [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e4731a85-ffca-4112-8caf-cb0a96905778)
- Natural Resource Regions used in the summaries are sourced from the [`bcmaps` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcmaps/index.html)


### Code

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, they need to be run in order:

- 01_clean.R
- 02_analysis.R
- 03_visualize.R
- 04_output.R

Most packages used in the analysis can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`. You will need to install  [`bcgroundwater`](https://github.com/bcgov/envreportutils) using the `remotes` package:

```r
install.packages("remotes") # If you don't already have it installed

library(remotes)
install_github("bcgov/bcgroundwater")
```
 
An installation of LaTeX (e.g. MiKTex, MacTeX or [`tinytex`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tinytex/index.html)) is required to render the .Rmd file to PDF with `knitr`.

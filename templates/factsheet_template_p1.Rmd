NOTE: 
This block is a MARKDOWN comment block. But markdown isn't recognized when it's embedded inside latex code.
So any markdown between latex code blocks which \begin{...} and \end{...} won't work, including comments
So when commenting between \begin{...} and \end{...}, use either latex comments (%) or line r comments: `r #Comment`

This code below uses inline R input to be dynamic AND for comments
